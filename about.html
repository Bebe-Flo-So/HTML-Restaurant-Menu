        <h2> Origin Story</h2>
         <img src="assets/images/about.jpg">
        <p> Our roots began as a small eatery in a remote village in Thailand. Our founder,  Mr. Aat Aachara, had a passion for cooking and enjoyed sharing his cuisine with family and friends. His dream was to start a family-owned business. He had the opportunity to immigrate to Los Angeles, CA at the age of 30. With the support of his family he opened his first restaurant location in Los Angeles, CA. Today, his legacy continues through his children who have now opened other location throughout the US. </p>
